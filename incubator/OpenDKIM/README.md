# i-MSCP OpenDKIM plugin v2.0.0

Provides DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service through MILTER.

## Introduction

DKIM provides a way for senders to confirm their identity when sending email by
adding a cryptographic signature to the headers of the message.

## Requirements

- i-MSCP Serie â‰¥ 1.4.x

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin through the plugin management interface
2. Install the plugin through the plugin management interface

## Update

1. Be sure that all requirements as stated in the requirements section are met
2. Backup your plugin configuration file if needed
3. Upload the plugin through the plugin management interface

### Restore you plugin configuration file if needed

1. Restore your plugin configuration file (compare it with the new version
   first)
2. Update the plugin list through the plugin management interface

## Configuration

See [Configuration file](config.php)

When changing a configuration parameter in the plugin configuration file, don't
forget to trigger a plugin list update, else you're changes will not be token
into account.

## Testing

### Internal DKIM test

You can check on the command line if OpenDKIM is working for your domain by
running the following command:

```
opendkim-testkey -d example.com -s mail -vvv
```

The result should look similar like this one:

```
opendkim-testkey: checking key 'mail._domainkey.example.com'
opendkim-testkey: key not secure
opendkim-testkey: key OK
```

Note that the 'key not secure' does not indicate an error. It is an expected
consequence of not using DNSSSEC.

You can also query your DNS server to check the TXT record for your domain:

```
dig -t txt mail._domainkey.example.com
```

### External DKIM test

Go to [dkimvalidator.com](http://dkimvalidator.com)  send a mail from the
domain for which you activated OpenDKIM to the random mail address shown on
that page. Once you have sent the mail, click on the `View Results` button and
verify the DKIM information section. You should get a result similar to:

```

```
