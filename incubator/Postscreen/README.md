# i-MSCP Postscreen plugin v1.2.0

Provides Postscreen daemon for Postfix.

## Introduction

The Postfix postscreen(8) daemon provides additional protection against mail
server overload. One postscreen(8) process handles multiple inbound SMTP
connections, and decides which clients may talk to a Postfix SMTP server
process.

By keeping spambots away, postscreen(8) leaves more SMTP server processes
available for legitimate clients, and delays the onset of server overload
conditions.

## Warning

Before installing this plugin, you're greatly encouraged to read the Postscreen
howto for Postfix which is available at [Postfix Postscreen Howto](http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html)

Be in mind that when using Postscreen, the mail clients must not submit mails
through the port 25. This is also true when not using the Postscreen plugin
anyway. Indeed, the port 25 should be used by SMTP servers only. Mail clients
should be configured to submit mails through the submission port which is 587,
or eventually but not recommended, the port 465 for SSL connection.
